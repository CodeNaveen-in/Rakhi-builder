## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini API (`@google/genai`) for image generation.
- **Image Export**: `html-to-image` library to convert the final SVG/HTML canvas to a PNG.
- **No Build Step**: The project runs directly in the browser using ES Modules and an `importmap`.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You need a modern web browser that supports ES Modules. You will also need a Google Gemini API Key to use the AI image generation feature.

- [Get a Google Gemini API Key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/rakhi-builder.git
    cd rakhi-design-studio
    ```

2.  **Create an environment file:**
    Create a new file named `.env` in the root of your project directory. This file will store your secret API key and will be ignored by Git.

3.  **Add your API Key:**
    Open the `.env` file and add your Google Gemini API key as follows:
    ```
    API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY"
    ```

4.  **Run the application:**
    Since this project does not have a build step, you just need to serve the files with a local web server. One of the easiest ways is to use the [Live Server extension in VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).

    Alternatively, you can use any simple command-line server. For example, with Node.js installed:
    ```bash
    # If you don't have 'serve' installed, install it globally
    npm install -g serve

    # Run the server from the project root
    serve
    ```
    Now, open your browser and navigate to the local URL provided (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).

## üé® How to Use

1.  **Add Elements**: Use the "Add Elements" panel to add circles, squares, or text to the canvas.
2.  **Select & Edit**: Click on any element on the canvas to select it. The "Edit Selection" panel will appear, allowing you to change its size, rotation, color, or text content.
3.  **Generate AI Pictures**:
    - Select a shape (like a circle).
    - Go to the "AI Pictures" panel.
    - Click on an object (e.g., "Peacock"). An AI-generated cartoon image of a peacock will be created and applied as the fill for your selected shape.
4.  **Manage Layers**: Use the "Layers" panel to see all your elements. You can reorder them, delete them, or select them from this list.
5.  **Design the Rope**: Customize the Rakhi's rope using the "Rope & Ends" panel.
6.  **Download**: Once you are happy with your design, click the "Download PNG" button to save your creation!
